          The Anaheim Convention Center is a major convention center in Anaheim,
          California. It is located across from the Disneyland Resort on Katella
          Avenue. The original components, designed by Adrian Wilson &
          Associates and built by Del E. Webb Corporation, opened in July
          1967—including a basketball arena followed shortly by the convention
          hall. It holds many events, like VidCon, BlizzCon, Anime Expo, D23
          Expo, WonderCon, NAMM Show, competitions, and more. In addition to
          hosting various types of conventions, the Anaheim Convention Center
          was used to host the wrestling during the 1984 Summer Olympics
