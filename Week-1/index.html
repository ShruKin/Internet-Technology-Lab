    <h1>B.D.M. International</h1>
    <p>
      BDMI was incepted on 1st May, 1966 by Late Mrs Usha Mehta, our founder
      principal. Henceforth, there was no looking back and soon young minds were
      nurtured into responsible citizens of India. The school has traversed a
      long path in all these years and it has been a never-ending journey
      towards holistic educational excellence. Today BDMI is not just a school
      but a social, academic and personal excellence community to empower
      diverse learners to be global citizens. We offer them not just education
      and knowledge but an environment of mutual respect, trust and
      understanding. We are committed to achieve outstanding results in
      academics, extra and co-curricular activities but at the same time
      dedicated to produce happy citizens who are steeped in rich Indian
      traditions and core values while learning international standard
      edification.
